Think of it like this:

Request In: Client -> Middleware -> Route -> Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Model -> Database
                                                           (optional) (optional)
Response Out: Database -> Model -> Repository -> Service -> Controller -> Directly to Client
                                   (optional)    (optional) 

**Explanation of the Horizontal Diagram:**

* **Client (Browser, App):** // The user's interface initiates the API call.
* **Backend Server (Entry Point: app.js):** // The main file of the Node.js application receives the request.
* **Middleware (Processes Requests):** // Functions that run before the route handler for tasks like authentication, data parsing, logging.
* **Route (supplier.js):** // Defines the API endpoints (URLs) and connects them to specific controller functions.
* **Controller (Handles Request & Calls Service):** // Receives the request, validates data, and orchestrates the business logic by calling the service layer.
* **Service (Business Logic, Data Operations):** // Contains the core logic of the application and interacts with the **Model** to manage data.
* **Repository (Data Access Layer):** // A dedicated layer (often a separate set of files or functions within the `services` or a dedicated `repositories` directory) responsible for the direct interaction with the database. It uses the **Model** to perform CRUD operations. This adds a layer of abstraction between the service logic and the database implementation.
* **Model (Implicitly used by Service):** // Although not explicitly a box in this flow, the **Model (`models/supplier.js`)** defines the structure and how to interact with the data in the database. The Service layer uses the Model to perform database operations.
* **Database (MongoDB):** // The persistent storage where the application's data resides.
* **Data Response:** // The formatted data (usually JSON) sent back from the Backend Server (specifically the Controller) to the Client.
