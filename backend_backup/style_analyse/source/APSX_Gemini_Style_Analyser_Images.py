        Carefully analyze the provided soccer penalty kick images from the player angle and generate a "style score" based on their technique with the following considerations:

Technique: Did the player exhibit interesting or unorthodox kicking technique, if so give them alot of points.  If they are wearing brightly coloured clothing (white included) put them in the 80s.

Scoring guide:

Base score
- standing still: 50-60
- slow run up : 60-70
- energetic run up : 80-90
- celebration dance, backwards kick, kicking ball from hand, spinning, throwing ball   : 90-99

Bonus score
- plain dark clothing : +0-10 bonus points
- brightly colours : +10-20 bonus points
- bold patterns (e.g animal print, strips) : instant 99 max points

Total score = base + bonus

And the total score maxing out at 99 (even if it calculates to be over 99)

Also Your job is to pick the best "hero" moment of someone kicking a soccer ball from the following photos.
        Top tip for conventional kicks: Select the moment where the kicking leg is fully cocked back (the leg wind up moment that shows "the power of the kick") just before the player begins to swing their kicking leg through. 
        For unconventional kicks just pict the photo that looks the coolest.
        Here is teh sequence of photos to choose from (use a zero base index so the first image is "0", and the second is "1", etc)

        Images:
